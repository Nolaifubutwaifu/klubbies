// The one list of what Klubbies does, for every public page.
//
// Home, How it works and the legal pages all read from here so they promise
// the same thing in the same words (audit finding M6). Rule for editing: a
// line goes in only when the feature is live in the app. Checked against the
// code on 26 Sep 2026:
//
//   - sign-in codes are 8 digits (Supabase mints 8 for this project)
//   - the per-album upload option is labelled "Any member" / "Committee only"
//   - photo removal requests are live and on by default; the photo hides at
//     once and the committee confirms (silence confirms after 7 days)
//   - the new album email is sent when an album is published
//   - "Save to Photos" uses the phone's share sheet; laptops get a zip
//   - roster import reads CSV, TSV, XLSX and XLS
//   - face recognition is on for every club by default (the committee can
//     turn it off); each member still chooses whether to add a selfie
//
// Not claimed anywhere, because it is not true: a free period before the
// first album, double-tap to favourite, or exact scheduled publishing times
// (the daily cron makes those approximate).
